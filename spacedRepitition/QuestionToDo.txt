System Design - learn
AI - learn

NOTE: TO - Do
- add more medium and hard questions
- find a way to randomally select a question    
        for particle + mock interview + for which I don't know the
        topic or method i.e. whether it's a dp or dfs or bfs or something

Self Mock Interview - On practice Questions always - ideal
but on tues, thur, and sat
    - randomally select questions using notion due Today table
        where select first column which is columns names
        and put it into wheelofnames.come to choose a random question

- One hard everyday + one,two medium questions practice everyday
- after which we will change to different compaines questions
