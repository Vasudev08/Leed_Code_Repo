## Intro

Hi, I'm Vasudev Agarwal, a senior at Texas A&M majoring in computer science with a focus on AI and machine learning.
Over the past year, I've worked on several hands-on projects - from leading an 8-person team to build a mobile app for a non-profit as a product manager to
working on medical devices at Alcon

Currently, I'm also spent time on research in XR/VR and computer vision.
I'm really excited to be here today - happy to jump into technical problems or walk through anything you'd like to hear more about.

## Ending Questions

- If I were to join your team, what mindset would help me succeed in the first 90 days ?
- How do you keep learning here - technically or professionally ?
- If you could go back and give yourself one piece of advice before joining Amazon, what would it be?

## Story Bank

### 1. Customer Obsession (customer is the king)

- Tell me about a time you went above and beyond for a customer or user.

  - **Develop For Good - All Grow Association Non-Profit**
  - S: I was working as a product manager for a non-profit called AllGrow non-profit association through develop for good organization managing a team of 8. Our team had engineer manager which wreen't the most active.
  - T: Increase the productivity and making sure we our hitting our sprint goals as wel

  - A: So, I took on the responability of hearing different hats working as a developer, Product Manager and Engineer Manager as well
  - R: Being able to hit our sprint goals, make progress on our daily sprints and stuff like that

  - **Alcon - Medical Devices - Senior Year**

### 2. Ownership

- Tell me about a time you took responsibility for something outsie your formal role
- Describe a time when you found a problem that no one else noticed and fixed it.
- Tell me about a time you owned a project end-to-end.

  - **Develop For Good - All Grow Association Non-Profit - Senior**

    - S: I was working as a product manager for a non-profit called AllGrow non-profit association through develop for good organization managing a team of 8. Our team had engineer manager which wreen't the most active.
    - T: And I could see that the team producicity was inefficietive seeing the situation, I unoffically took on the role of engineer manager.
    - A: I involved myself more into the role of engineer manager and at same time training one of the develpers to take-up the role of engineer manager. involving myself meant, that I would role an important role in distributing the tasks, co-ordinate tech inssues between the engineers, handling the client, sharing knowledge by teach stack. also teaching and be transprant on disucssion making process
    - R: Will, I don't have a quantity metric to measure the improvement, I think our team performed much better as I was able to take some important tasks of engineer manager and take help of my developers.
    - INCLUDE: Winter Student Start-up Experience through start-up fast pass
    - INCLUDE: Joining Start-Up with a student, where I learned about mobile app development
    - INCLUDE: Computer Vision and VR/XR Research
    - new to agile development process, new to frontend and backend development , new to talkgin in the meetings, and handling the client as well

  - **Uhnder Inc. - StartUp Experience - FreshMan Year**
    - S: Uhnder Inc. was developing a 4D Lidar Chips which were to be placed inside car, which meant improving and measuring realibity. To check the realibility of these chips were placed under an temperature chamber where the temperature cycle went from -45 C to 125 C
    - T: Mesure the realibility of various chips and at the same time taking note of the at which cycle no. did the chip failed. (i.e. infinite resistance)
    - A: The previous implementation for checking realibity was binary, as in if the resistance is below the thresold then was chip is still works whereas if above this meant the chip failed. My action was to implement of new dynamic way for measuring realibity using linear regression model which was build using historical data and used for predicting resistance. So, I implement a python program using pandas module, and data-analysis t
    - R: I was able to achieve 60% reduction in data analysis time, also ensured the robutiness of the program by back-testing it, also ensured an 24X7 operational hour

### 8. Think Big

- **Alcon - Medical Devices - Senior Year** - Long term advantages of software, maintainability, choosing tech stack apprioately

### 9. Bias for Action

- Describe a time you made a decision without having all the data
- Tell me about a time you had to move quickly on a project
- Tell me about a time you made a mistake by acting too quickky. What did you learn ?

- Have you ever automated something manually done before ?

### 14. Deliver Results

- Tell me about a time you had to meet a tough deadline
- Describe a time you had to finish a project despite challenges or contraints.
- What's your prodest techincal accomplishement ? Why ?

### 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

- Tell me about a time you disagreed with a team-mate or manager
- Describe a time you were convinced you were right - how did you make your case ?
- Tell me about a time you disagreed but still followed through with the decision
